# Iterating a collection

**For each exercise, use the corresponding `.js` file in this folder (e.g.: the exercise's 1 resolution should be placed in the `level_2/exercise_2_1.js` file).**

## Exercises

1. Create a collection of at least 5 primitive values (`number`, `string` or `boolean`). Then, iterate over it and print its values.

2. Create a collection of at least 5 objects with the following properties: `fullName` (string), `age` (number) and `gender` (string). Then, iterate over it and print the properties of each object.

3. Create a collection of at least 5 elements. These elements will represent users, and it should be a mix of `string` values (which should be email addresses) and objects with the property `email` (string). Then, iterate over it and print ONLY the users whose email address is a google email address (`@gmail.com`).
